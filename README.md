# Sonic Search Engine

This is a mini search engine I created to find data on Sonic characters. 

As at present, the app is only limited to searching data via characters' names.

I created this app to familiarise myself with HTTP request methods (a.k.a verbs), back-end concepts and how to use the express web framework.
